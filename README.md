# üåç Global Energy Analysis

This project explores renewable, hydroelectric, and nuclear energy trends across regions and income groups using real datasets from the OECD and World Bank  
It was completed as part of a university coursework but has been extended and documented as an independent portfolio project.

## üìå Project Overview
The analysis investigates:
1. How renewable energy production has evolved across regions over time.  
2. What percentage of total energy supply is derived from renewable sources.  
3. The relationship between GDP and hydroelectric power usage.  
4. How nuclear energy consumption varies across income groups.

## üõ† Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib  
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning, merging, handling missing values  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Grouping, trend analysis, correlation  
- **Data Visualization**: Line plots, scatter plots, comparative charts  
- **Report Writing**: Communicating insights and discussing limitations

## üìä Key Findings
- **Renewable Energy**:  
  - Europe & Central Asia showed the fastest growth in renewable energy production.  
  - East Asia & Pacific had consistent growth driven by industrial expansion.  
  - North America grew more gradually due to reliance on fossil fuels.  

- **Renewable % of Total Supply**:  
  - Europe & Central Asia significantly increased their renewable share.  
  - East Asia & Pacific and North America increased too, but more slowly.  

- **GDP vs Hydroelectric (2015)**:  
  - Wealthier countries tended to have greater shares of hydroelectric power, but geography and policy strongly influenced results.  

- **Nuclear Energy by Income Group**:  
  - High-income countries consistently had the largest share of nuclear energy.  
  - Upper-middle-income countries showed gradual adoption.  
  - Low-income countries had little or no nuclear usage.
